    //Like Binary Search, Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays. The basic idea is to check fewer
    // elements (than linear search) by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching
    // all elements.
    //Letâ€™s consider the following array: (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610).
    // The length of the array is 16. Jump search will find the value of 55 with the following steps assuming that the
    // block size to be jumped is 4.

    //STEP 1: Jump from index 0 to index 4;
    //STEP 2: Jump from index 4 to index 8;
    //STEP 3: Jump from index 8 to index 12;
    //STEP 4: Since the element at index 12 is greater than 55 we will jump back a step to come to index 8.
    //STEP 5: Perform a linear search from index 8 to get the element 55.
